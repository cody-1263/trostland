## r/DTG applications



Users coming from r/DTG will sometimes apply straight on bungie.net.

**Option 1:**

Send them a message on bungie.net and direct them to seismic discord (the message template is below).

**Option 2:**

1. Accept their b.net application
2. Place them in the spreadsheet, only bungie name and check b.net checkbox
3. Send them a message in b.net, directing them to seismic discord
4. ???
5. If they apply on seismic website, it's all good
6. If they don't, after one week kick them from b.net clan and remove them from the spreadsheet

**b.net message text:**
